This is a mlsql-lang example project.

## Installation Of MLSQL Lang IDE


1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download MLSQL Lang VSCode plugin
    * [Winwdows](http://download.mlsql.tech/mlsql-win-0.0.6.vsix)

## Tutorial

1. `./src/try_mlsql` is a good start point for you to learn MLSQL.
2. `./src/a_tour_of_mlsql` you can learn full picture of MLSQL Lang.
3. `./src/examples/examples` there are many mlsql code snippets in this notebook.
4. `./analysis/example/cifar10/ResizeImage` teach you how to processing image distributly.
5. `./analysis/example/cifar10/DistributeTFTrainning` teach you how to train DL by tensorflow distributly and deploy model as UDF .

## Python Script Support

`Ray` is a build-in plugin in MLSQL which can execute Python script. 

The power part is that you can 
access the data in target table in Python and pass the result processed back as a new table.

Some limitation for now:

1. The schema of python output should be specified mannually.

```shell
!python conf "schema=st(field(a,long))";
```

The basic python dependencies:

```
pyarrow==4.0.1
ray[default]
aiohttp==3.7.4
pandas>=1.0.5; python_version < '3.7'
pandas>=1.2.0; python_version >= '3.7'
requests
matplotlib~=3.3.4
uuid~=1.30
pyjava
```

Suppose you can have created virtual python enviroment called `ray1.8.0` (this will used by example in this project by default). 

```
conda create  --name ray1.8.0 python=3.6
```
and make sure you have the aforementioned dependencies are also installed.
